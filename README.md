End-to-end data analysis project - customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and PowerBI

# Overview
This project explores how Sam’s Mart, a leading retail company, can leverage consumer shopping data to better understand customer behavior and enhance business performance. Using a comprehensive customer dataset, the analysis focuses on identifying key factors influencing purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and channels (online vs. offline).
The study investigates how elements such as discounts, product reviews, seasonal trends, and payment preferences affect customer engagement, conversion rates, and repeat purchases. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, the project uncovers actionable insights that can help Sam’s Mart:
