# Sam's Mart - Customer Behavior Analysis
End-to-end data analysis project - customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and PowerBI

# 1. Overview
This project explores how Sam’s Mart, a leading retail company, can leverage consumer shopping data to better understand customer behavior and enhance business performance. Using a comprehensive customer dataset, the analysis focuses on identifying key factors influencing purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and channels (online vs. offline).
The study investigates how elements such as discounts, product reviews, seasonal trends, and payment preferences affect customer engagement, conversion rates, and repeat purchases. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, the project uncovers actionable insights that can help Sam’s Mart:

 - Identify emerging shopping trends and customer segments
 - Optimize marketing and promotional strategies
 - Improve customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty
   
By transforming raw customer data into strategic insights, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in shaping smarter retail decisions.

# 3. Tools
 - **Python** - Data Preparation & Modelling

Used for cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw customer data.

 - **SQL** - Data Analysis

Applied to organize and query the dataset, simulate business transactions, and extract insights on customer segmentation, loyalty patterns, and purchase behavior.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

I began with data preparation and cleaning in Python:
 - **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using pandas.
 - **Initial Exploration:** Used df.info() to check structure and .describe() for summary statistics

- **Handling Missing Data:** Checked for null values and imputed missing values in the Review Rating column using the median rating of each product category.
- **Column Standardization:** Renamed columns to **snake case** for better readability and documentation.
- **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created **age_group** column by binning customer ages.
   - Created **purchase_frequency_days** column from purchase data.
- Data Consistency Check: Verified if **discount_applied** and **promo_code_used** were redudant; dropped **promo_code_used**.
- **Database Integration:** Connected Python script to MySQL and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL analysis.
